            <h2>The Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)</h2>
            <p>
                The battle in 1631 was the first battle of Breitenfeld.
                The two parties in this battle were the Roman Catholic Church and the Swedish Saxon army.
                The church consisted of the army of the Roman Catholic emperor Ferdinand II and the Catholic League led by Johan Isaclaes, Graf von Tilly; both of the armies came out to be about 35-thousand men.
                The Swedish-Saxon army of about 39-thousand men was led by King Gustav II Adolf of Sweden.
                King Gustav II's 23-thousand men came together with 16-thousand men from the Electoral of Saxon, coming out to be about 39-thousand men.
                The battle began on September 17th where both armies met near Breitenfeld, both sides had gone back and forth with their artillery from noon to 2:00 PM.
                Around 5:00 PM, King Gustav II had sent a counterattack which had badly injured Tilly, leading to a retreat at dusk by the Church.
                The battle ended in a defeat for the Roman Catholic Church, which is considered to be the first major victory for the Swedish in the 30-year war.
